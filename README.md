# final-project
My final project is a news app on Prince George’s County food inspection data. I pulled the data from the Prince George’s County open data portal’s JSON database. While the data goes back to 2013, I only pulled data into my SQLite3 database from 2016 onwards. I deployed my news app within GitHub codespaces. As of right now, the app is not automated to update whenever the Prince George’s County open data portal updates their data. This is because I didn’t have time to do so, but also because I did not think this was a priority as the dataset has not been updated in over two months (even though it is supposed to be updated daily).

My news app contains a main page, which shows how many restaurants in Prince George’s have had one or more critical violations in the past 60 days. The main page also has a search bar in which you can search by restaurant name, owner, address, zip code or even unique ID number. Only people who frequent the app will likely use a unique ID number, but I included it because I could foresee it being helpful and also because it was a challenge to get the search bar to differentiate between zip code and unique ID, so I kept it in for future reference. When you search for something, a table pops up and you can click on an establishment’s unique ID to learn more about their food inspection history.

One issue I had on the main page was with the ‘number of critical violations in the past 60 days’ header text. I had a tough time narrowing down the time frame I wanted to focus on (a year seems like the obvious choice but aren’t smaller time frames more helpful? But the dataset isn’t updated very often? argh!). I attempted a drop down menu and then buttons using JavaScript to let the user explore different time frames. However, getting the text to change dynamically with user input was very difficult for me to navigate given my limited JavaScript skills, so I just opted for 60 days. 

The navigation bar at the top has some options to explore as well. The first is an ‘About’ page which details why Prince George completes food inspections, who gets inspected and what the different kinds of inspections mean. This is the section of the app in which I wish I could have actually done some reporting. I wish I could have offered more comprehensive information on the data than just what the open data portal provides, but maybe I will add to it. 

Next, the ‘timeline’ page gives me more JavaScript struggle flashbacks. I tried to use Charts.js to create an interactive chart, but after about a day of struggling with it, I decided I didn’t have that kind of time to waste and just made a Flourish graphic. Creating this graphic really forced me to buckle down on what I thought was most important, and I wonder if this graphic should actually be the main point of the app: Why is Prince George’s County decreasing their number of food inspections?

This is also a page I think could have benefitted from additional reporting. It was difficult for me to format text on this page in a way that didn’t feel cluttered, so I let the graphic speak for itself. I think there is a better way to do this, but it is what it is. 

The last page in the navigation bar is the ‘data’ page where users can download the data in my database as a CSV file. I figured nearly every news app needs to have something like this for transparency and exploration purposes. I also originally had a table including Every. Single. Row. from my database that users could filter and explore, but every time I tried to play with it my computer started threatening to explode in my face. I decided to ditch that idea, especially since I’m already giving people the data as a CSV.

I deleted so many ideas throughout the process of making this news app. The main page used to have a table on it and there used to be so many other elements to the app. I think it looks better now with less on it, but I still feel like there’s a lot to explore in this data that I’m not doing with this app. Looking forward, I would like to automate this app to fetch more data from the JSON on a monthly basis and then have the numbers in the app update accordingly. This would mean I have to win a battle with JavaScript, especially for the graph on the timeline page, but it’s definitely possible. Luckily, it would be easy to compare the numbers scraped to the dataset on the open data portal site, so making sure my numbers are correct wouldn’t be too difficult if this were to be automated. 

I feel this app has already outlived its usefulness. I have the main point, which is that food inspections are happening at a declining rate. Without regularly updated data, who cares about food inspections that happened two, going on three, months ago? Maybe I will email Prince George’s County data custodians to see when/if data will be updated to better understand this app's lifespan. However, the data will outlive the bot, as it is in a database.
